## Included Skills

- `coding-workflow` — runs the approved coding workflow only when explicitly invoked.
- `team-memory` — curates reusable memory into project/team memory or cross-project habits only when explicitly invoked.
- `idea-shaping` — shapes product, feature, project, startup, side-project, or internal-tool ideas when explicitly invoked.
- `writing-skills` — creates, edits, and verifies skills with a TDD-style workflow only when explicitly invoked.

## Canonical Rules

Use `PROJECT_SPEC.md` as the source of truth for adding or changing skills.

Core rules:

- The repository root is the plugin root.
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the canonical plugin manifest.
- Skills live directly under `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`.
- This plugin currently contains exactly `coding-workflow`, `team-memory`, `idea-shaping`, and `writing-skills`.
- Skill descriptions must require explicit invocation and must not use broad semantic task categories as auto-trigger descriptions.

## Validation

Run:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/validate.ps1
```

## Codex And Shared Agent Usage

Tools that consume `SKILL.md` directories can copy or symlink selected directories from `skills/` into their runtime skill directories. See `adapters/` for runtime-specific notes.
